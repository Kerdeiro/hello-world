Learning Github

Hi !

This is my first time using Github. I am interested in learning how to code so I can hopefully make a career change. Currently I am an accountant, but I think I want to be a devolper of some sort. Maybe develop useful apps for phones or even gaming apps. I have only just begun to learn, and still need more practice before I am ready to contribute to any open sources.
